The first thing you need to do is create a free account with Coinrule. There's no credit card required and it takes about 60 seconds. Once your account is created, the system will guide you through setting up an API key on Coinbase which allows Coinrule to trade on your behalf without owning any of coins! If this sounds like something you're interested in, read more below for tips on how to use the bot.

\- You can set specific coin pairs which are paired together by default: BTC/LTC, ETH/XMR

\- Automated trading adjusts these values according to demand - if one cryptocurrency has higher value then another that same day, it will  trade in order to maximize profits

\- You can set a max profit and loss amount per trade. If the trades go over what you have specified, they will no longer work until your settings are adjusted

\- Your API key on Coinbase is encrypted with AES 256 encryption for security! No one has access to it but you (including us!)

We see that automated trading is now possible not only through our service, Coinrule, but also via other brokers or exchanges which offer cryptocurrency trading bots.
