## What is Pirate Chain?

Pirate Chain is a decentralised cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin core, with modifications to add privacy and anonymity features. Pirate Chain differs from other cryptocurrencies in that it allows users to remain anonymous. The key to this is through its use of Mimblewimble which encrypts transactions within blocks. Furthermore, PirateChain does not have any traditional miners and instead uses something called “Bootstraps” which are created by nodes with high online availability time and large amounts of coins in their wallets.

Pirate Chain is the first cryptocurrency to implement a mandatory, private-only usage of zk-SNARK - one of the best and most highly acclaimed privacy protocols in the industry.

Pirate Chain’s default is that all transactions are invisible to the public, making them difficult to track. All of Pirate Chain’s addresses are in its anonymity set, among the largest in the industry. ARRR is secured by dPoW (delayed proof of work), which links the ARRR blockchain to Bitcoin's blockchain, making it difficult to attack. Created in 2018 with no pre-mine or block reward, Pirate Chain seeks to protect the financial privacy of every user on the planet.
