## Get $25 US in CRO by setting up a Crypto.com account using our link!

[Crypto.com](/link/sign-up-crypto-dot-com) is one of the top exchanges when it comes to cryptocurrency.  Crypto.com describe this as "The only Crypto Card you Need".  

It comes with no annual fees, up to 8% back on spending and a whole host of rewards in the form of reimbursements on Spotify and Netflix.

## Is the crypto.com Visa Card a debit card?

Crypto.com describe their card as a prepaid card.  This is because it has the same functionality as a debit card, but it needs to be topped up.  You can use your other bank accounts or cryptocurrency to top it up.

## How does it work?

All you have to do is to complete sign up, pass KYC verification and you will get a Sign Up-Bonus ($25 USD* in CRO locked in your CRO Wallet).

You get $25 USD* in CRO in your CRO Wallet instantly once you have successfully reserved a Metal Crypto.com Visa Card.

## How can I request a Crypto.com Card?

You can manage and request your crypto.com card all through the Crypto.com app which is available on the Apple App Store as well as the Google Play Store.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros**

* Quick confirmation (< 5mins).
* 24/7 customer support.
* Available in the UK, Europe, the United States, Canada, and Singapore.
* Purchase and offer 90+ cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), at the genuine currency exchange rate.
* It is 100% **FREE** to open a [Crypto.com](/link/sign-up-crypto-dot-com) account.
* The Crypto.com Visa Card has zero month-to-month maintenance charge or monthly fee.
* You can get as much as 8% cashback whenever you use your Crypto.com Visa Card. You can also get other advantages (like 100% cashback on Spotify, Netflix, and Amazon Prime).
* Contactless Visa Debit cards (released and delivered free of charge).
* Get up to 10% cashback when you buy gift cards for popular brands with your cryptocurrency balance (30+ countries supported).

**Cons**

* You need to stake a lot of CRO to open the greatest rebates.  CRO is typically a little more volatile than Bitcoin and is subject to increases and decreases depending on the market.
* Users report that the Crypto.com Visa Card isn't being issued for months after buying.
* Crypto Earn provides lower rate of interest if you do not lock-up your cryptocurrency deposit for 3 months.

## Crypto.com Metal Cards

With the [Crypto.com](/link/sign-up-crypto-dot-com) Visa Card, you can also spend your cryptocurrency anywhere that Visa is normally accepted around the world (and get up to 8% back).

Crypto.com offer a number of different metal cards based on how much you decide to stake on the platform.  Essentially the more crypto you put into the platform the more cash back and perks you get.

## The best card for the Crypto ballers

At the time of writing the **Obsidian card** will give you a whopping 8% cashback in CRO if you stake the equivalent of $400,000 in CRO.  If you have this amount of investment available then 8% cashback and the perks are very attractive.

For this you get reimbursements on Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Expedia, Airbnb, Airport Lounge Access a host of other benefits such as an exclusive merchandise welcome pack and ofcourse crucially the Private Jet Partnership.  The Obsidian card is the only Crypto.com card to come with the Private Jet Partnership.

## The best card for the casual crypto users

The **Midnight Blue** card will give you 1% cashback, is free to request and really is a no brainer in our opinion, you don't even have to stake any CRO so there really is no risk on your investment.  

If you are just starting to dip your toes into the crypto game then you may be interested in the **Ruby Steel** card which requires a $400 CRO stake and you will get double the cashback of the Midnight Blue card.  You also get an intro to some of the Crypto.com perks such as a **reimbursement for Spotify**.  With Spotify in the UK costing £9.99 per month (£120 per year) this means that you will likely get back quite a sizable chunk of your investment if you are opting for the Ruby card, so if you are a Spotify junkie then this may be a good move and lets be honest, in a bull market the Crypto.com cards will beat any AMEX card hands down.

## Is it the best Crypto Card?

I personally use the crypto.com card and have the Ruby card. With the Ruby card you get free Spotify reimbursements which are paid in CRO.  As the Crypto.com card is a Visa card it can be used anywhere you would normally use your traditional Visa card.

There are lots of crypto cards out there at the moment, but the Crypto.com cards have some great perks
