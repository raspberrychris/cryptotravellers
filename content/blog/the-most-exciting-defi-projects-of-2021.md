The future is now. It's time to get excited about the next decade of advances in [DeFi technology](/defi-explained), which will be more exciting than any other decade in history.  

This article highlights some of the most exciting DeFi projects for 2021.

## What is DeFi?

The Decentralised Financial sector, which is called "[DeFi](/defi-explained)," refers to a crypto sector that works on bringing traditional finance features into the cryptocurrency world. It does this by dividing and de-centralising these services.

Decentralised finance projects typically encompass dApps for user-created token issuance, infrastructure such as asset management tools and decentralised exchanges, and more.

## What is Tokenomics?

The word **Tokenomics** is a portmanteau of "Token" and "Economics" It is the study of understanding the supply and demand economic factors that can impact a cryptocurrency. 

### Supply

The supply of a cryptocurrency is based on three factors.

The first one is the current resource, which indicates the total number of coins or tokens available in a system.

The second thing to consider when evaluating potential for a cryptocurrency are the maximum quantity and circulation.

### Market Cap

The market cap of a cryptocurrency represents the total amount of money invested in that currency.  A low circulating supply and and a high market cap will make the coin or token more valuable.
