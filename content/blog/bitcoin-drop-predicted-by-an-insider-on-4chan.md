# Bitcoin Drop Predicted by an Insider On 4Chan

A widely shared message on the 4Chan message board has got the crypto community talking recently, the message posted by an anonymous user claiming to be an ‘insider’ says that he is part of a coordinated effort to liquidate “one certain stakeholder.”

The anonymous insider implied that he worked for a large company within the PRC.  The FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) caused by the [subsequent press release](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/) he implied was part of this effort.

## Will Bitcoin go to $70K?

The insider also seems to suggest that this is a coordinated effort designed to liquidate a single stakeholder and goes as far as to suggest that the price of Bitcoin will go to $70k following the stakeholder’s liquidation.   

## The Follow Up Message: Going Short Until $25k
