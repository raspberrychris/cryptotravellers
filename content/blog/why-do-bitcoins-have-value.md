Bitcoin is a digital currency, and it's been around since 2009. It was created by an unknown person or group of people called Satoshi Nakamoto. And just like any other currency, Bitcoin has value because it is worth something to someone.

The value of bitcoins goes up and down over time based on what people are willing to pay for them at the time. Just like stocks (shares in companies), you can buy Bitcoins with money but they're not backed by anything except their own perceived value as a form of investment; which means that if the price falls enough then its investors will "lose" everything invested into them.
