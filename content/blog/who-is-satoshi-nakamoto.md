Satoshi Nakamoto is the inventor of Bitcoin, and has been a mystery since 2009. His identity has never been confirmed, but many people have made their guesses about who he might be. Some speculate that Satoshi is Japanese or Australian because his writing style resembles these languages.

Many people are asking this question and many believe they know the answer, but no one knows for sure.

The [Bitcoin Foundation](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/) has said it's a pseudonym for someone who is probably Japanese. Others speculate that he could be an American programmer named [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) or a Finnish sociologist [Dr. Vili Lehdonvirta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vili_Lehdonvirta). Some have even speculated that Satoshi Nakamoto may be a group of people, not just one individual. The real identity remains unknown to the public at large and these theories will likely continue in perpetuity until we get more concrete information about the creator of Bitcoin from him or her directly...or if we ever do at all!

## How much is Satoshi Nakamoto worth?

The founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is a mystery. There are many theories about his identity and background but no one knows for sure who he is or where he came from. One thing we do know is that the current market value of all Bitcoins in circulation (about $10 billion) would make him worth at least $1 billion.

In 2008, a white paper entitled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" was published. In this paper, the author, who called themselves Satoshi Nakamoto - laid out a plan for an electronic cash system that would allow people to make payments without passing through a financial institution. The goal of Bitcoin is to provide individuals and businesses with a fast, efficient way to make transactions while avoiding costly middlemen.

## But who exactly is Satoshi Nakamoto? 

The identity of Bitcoin's creator has been a mystery for years. In 2008, the white paper "[Bitcoin: A Peer to peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)" was published under this name and it laid out plans on how an electronic cash system would work without going through any financial institution or government entity - but who exactly IS that author? 

## Nick Szabo and Hal Finney

The first possibility we'll look at in detail are [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) and [Hal Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Finney_(computer_scientist)), who were both involved with bitcoin before its release date as well. Hal even received bitcoins from one transaction made by what he believed might have actually be Satoshi Nakamoto.

Hal Finney was a computer scientist and cryptographer who is credited with being the first person to use bitcoin. He also created what's known as "reusable proof of work" which helped make mining possible, but he sadly passed away in 2014 before seeing any profits from his invention, so it seems unlikely that this could be him.

However there are some similarities between Hal Finney’s writing style compared against Satoshi Nakamoto: they both have very similar sentence structure patterns (such like using periods at end-of sentences), their vocabulary usage matches up well too, for example “I am not sure if I will ever meet you or know your name...but thank you."

## Does Satoshi Nakamoto own Bitcoin?

One thing we do know is that the current market value of all Bitcoins in circulation (about $10 billion) would make Satoshi worth at least $1 billion.
