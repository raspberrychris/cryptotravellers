Satoshi Nakamoto is the inventor of Bitcoin, and has been a mystery since 2009. His identity has never been confirmed, but many people have made their guesses about who he might be. Some speculate that Satoshi is Japanese or Australian because his writing style resembles these languages.

Many people are asking this question and many believe they know the answer, but no one knows for sure.

The [Bitcoin Foundation](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/) has said it's a pseudonym for someone who is probably Japanese. Others speculate that he could be an American programmer named [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) or a Finnish sociologist [Dr. Vili Lehdonvirta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vili_Lehdonvirta). Some have even speculated that Satoshi Nakamoto may be a group of people, not just one individual. The real identity remains unknown to the public at large and these theories will likely continue in perpetuity until we get more concrete information about the creator of Bitcoin from him or her directly...or if we ever do at all!
