## Learn more about Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and it's also one of, if not "the" oldest. It was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto to be used as digital cash for transactions without any middlemen (like banks). Bitcoin has grown tremendously since its inception with many people now owning bitcoin wallets which are basically just long strings that contain their public key address so they can send/receive bitcoins from others who have theirs stored on them too! You'll want your own wallet before you start buying coins because there isn't really anywhere else where someone will store yours securely like this - otherwise anyone could take all those hard-earned crypto assets away at anytime.

## Bitcoin Wallets

Bitcoin.org - Bitcoin Core Wallet This is a full node wallet that downloads the entire blockchain to your computer and stores it in order for you be able use bitcoin without any third-party service or company, like Coinbase.

It's also open source so anyone can look at its code if they want too which means there are no hidden backdoors where someone could steal all of their coins from them... The downside though? There will always need internet access because this type needs an active connection with other nodes on what we call "the" network (which has been growing exponentially over time). So as longs as one person still uses bitcoins then everyone else does not have anything wrong happen either but when people stop using BTC than those who do

It's like having your own bank account in which you are able deposit and withdraw funds as needed without any third-party service or company, such at Coinbase.

The downside though? There will always need internet access because this kind needs an active connection with other nodes on what we call "the" network (which has been growing exponentially over time). So longs one person still uses bitcoins then everyone else does not have anything wrong happen either but when people stop using BTC than those who do use it could lose their coins if they don't back up/save them somewhere safe first! This can also lead into another problem where there may only ever exist 21 million bitcoin
