## What Makes a Bank Crypto Friendly?

When choosing a new bank, it is important to find a crypto-friendly institution that will allow you to purchase crypto as you require.

For instance we have had reports from our readers that banks like HSBC and First Direct can automatically block transactions from places like [Crypto.com](https://cryptotravellers.com/crypto-com-review/) with no explanation.  (In this particular example First Direct believed the [Crypto.com](/crypto-com-review/) app was at fault... it wasn't, attempting to purchase again with a Monzo card proved that!).

**How to know that your bank is crypto friendly:**

* Credit and debit cards issued by the bank can be used to buy and sell crypto.
* Wire transfers to cryptocurrency exchanges and similar entities are allowed.

> "So, we don’t have any issue with sensible, personal use of your account for Bitcoin trading. Obviously there are some platforms, like Coinbase, where 3DSecure is implemented and therefore our cards won’t currently work. Therefore, there shouldn’t be a problem unless you’re transferring huge sums." - Monzo Customer Support.
