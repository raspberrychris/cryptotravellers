**Blockchain domains can be used to build websites that are resistant to censorship. Traditional domain assets like Google Domains or GoDaddy, which store information on your behalf in their data centres, can be taken down by court orders and company bureaucracy.** 

> **A blockchain domain is controlled directly by yourself, so it's impossible for a third party to take it from you - no matter what.**

The blockchain domain is a decentralised, peer-to-peer network that allows users to register and transfer their domains without involvement of a third party.

Blockchains operate on the principle of consensus, which means there are no central authorities or middlemen involved in cross-domain transactions. This makes blockchain domains ideal for web developers who want to create an online marketplace where users can buy and sell website names with ease.

**Blockchain domains also offer three benefits over traditional domain registration:**

1. They're more secure because blockchain networks use encryption;
2. They reduce costs by bypassing the need for intermediaries;
3. They allow user anonymity as well as privacy protection due to the nature of blockchain technology.

## Blockchain Domains: How do they work?

Blockchain domains use blockchain networks to operate. Blockchain networks are distributed ledgers, which means every node is an equal participant and there's no central authority or middleman involved in transactions between nodes on the network. This lack of a third party makes blockchain domains ideal for web developers who want to create online marketplaces where users can buy and sell content, goods and services without the need for a central authority.

Blockchain networks are also more secure because they use encryption to keep data safe from prying eyes. They're not only better at thwarting hackers but traditional domain registrars as well: blockchain domains reduce costs by bypassing the need for intermediaries who charge high transaction fees.

## What is the difference between blockchain domains different and regular domains?

Blockchain domains are decentralised, meaning there's no single authority running the blockchain network. For example, you can buy a domain with Ethereum (ETH), and that purchase is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger. This means if your registrar goes out of business or loses your domain to a hacker attack, there would be no way for them to take your blockchain domain.

## Where do blockchain domains exist?

Blockchain domains sit on the decentralised web. This means that blockchain domains are not hosted on a centralised company server, but rather stored across many different computers.

Blockchain domains have existed since 2010 and they’re still growing in popularity today. The decentralised web is the perfect place for blockchain domain owners because it allows them to store their data without fear of losing it - or getting it stolen.

The decentralised web is the perfect place for blockchain domain owners because it allows them to store their data without fear of losing it - or getting it stolen. That’s not all: since blockchain domains are generated and stored on multiple computers, they also make censorship impossible. This means that there's no way for any blockchain domain owner to be completely shut down.

Blockchain Domains are the future of web domain ownership and will help us make the internet more accessible for everyone.

## Can I build a website with a decentralised domain?

**Yes**. Using a blockchain domain means that you can create decentralised websites, and many already exist. You can point your blockchain domain name to a website on a peer-to-peer hosting platform like IPFS, for example. It’s also possible to connect domains to social media accounts to verify identity and set up things like email and chat protocols associated with your domain.

## What is a .crypto domain?

The .crypto domain is minted as a nonfungible token (NFT) on the ethereum blockchain, the pricing starts at around $40 but can sell for as much as $100,000.

## How do I view a decentralised domain name?

Opera have [recently announced ](https://cointelegraph.com/news/web-browser-opera-integrates-crypto-domain-names-for-users-on-any-device)that you can "surf the decentralised web" on Opera, and they now offer full integration of .crypto names available to be viewed on any platform.  Once you have downloaded Opera you can visit [helloweb3.crypto](helloweb3.crypto) and the capability to surf decentralised domains is now built into the Opera browser - Amazing.

## What is the best bit about blockchain domains?

Once you have bought them, there are no renewal fees.  For project websites this might not be a big deal, but for companies this actually make business sense from an economic perspective to take ownership of a domain that is actually a fixed asset rather than one that you are paying for the use of yearly.
