## What is Cardano?

**Cardano** is a cryptocurrency network and open source platform that uses the  proof-of-stake technology to provide a secure blockchain that is less prone to tampering. 

**Cardano’s** technology allows developers to conduct tests on their programs without deploying the code. The goal of the **Cardano** network is to create and run a public blockchain platform for smart contract-derived applications.

Cardano’s system runs on its underlying coin — Ada, which is traded on major exchanges and holds value. If you’re passionate about the Cardano network project and its technology, investing in the Cardano coin can be an excellent way to both support the project and potentially earn money if the price of the coin rises in value as interest increases.
