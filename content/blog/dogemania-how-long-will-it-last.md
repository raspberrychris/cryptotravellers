Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that was born in 2013 when an Australian programmer named Jackson Palmer tweeted:

> "Investing in Dogecoin, pretty sure it's the next big thing.

(via @ummjackson, Twitter)

What started out as a joke has turned into one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on earth. A lot of people are wondering how long dogemania will last. Although it may seem strange, Dogecoin has a net worth of more than $86 billion and has now overtaken Honda in market capitalisation, and is hot on the heels of GeneralMotors Co - a company founded in 1908 - over a hundred years ago!  (Just let that sink in)....

Dogecoin has given some of the highest returns this year growing by a staggering 8000%, even Bitcoin by comparison has a return of just over 90%. Dogecoin's rise started in February following Elon Musk tweeting about the topic.

Investor interest in Dogecoin has been so strong that the RobinHood trading platform crashed following interest in Dogecoin.

The Dogefather - Elon Musk

Elon Musk has played a contributory part recently into accelerating the growth of Dogecoin. He has posted a number of tweets on Twitter that reference the coin and has referred to himself as the Dogefather on Twitter.

Endorsement from Snoop Dogg

Snoop Dogg has also also been a vocal supporter of dogecoin, even releasing an NFT collection named "Snoop Dogge Coins" referencing Doge.

Is it a bubble? Will it mature into a usable currency?

Many experienced traders are either staying completely clear of Dogecoin as they see it as too risky an investment, or alternatively they are buying the dips and banking all the way to the top - this ofcourse is a high risk high return strategy and you shouldn't rush to put your life savings into is a meme coin.

New investors to the space may get FOMO not realising that the coin could crash dramatically once the whales have had their fun.  Some twitter users have [drawn parallels between Doge and XRP](https://twitter.com/lowstrife/status/1389794278096965632?s=20).  It is definitely a good idea to do as much research as you can before you make a serious investment decision.

Elon Musk Hosting SNL

There have been some teasers that Elon Musk will be mentioning Doge on SNL, this will pump the price even higher and mean that it may be likely to top $1.00. Many investors are piling now for this very reason.

Dogecoin's rise has certainly turned some heads , but the question is: how long will it last?

Bitcoin's share price has been on a major downtrend for some time now, and with Bitcoin dominance at an all-time low of 46.02%, many analysts are questioning what this means for other altcoins - especially those that are not among the Top 20 coins by market cap.
