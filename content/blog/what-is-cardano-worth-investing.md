Cardano is a decentralised platform that allows individuals to carry out deals beyond borders and release wise agreements and decentralised apps (dApps). Cardano was introduced in 2017 to restore rely on economies through the integration of technology and likewise to allow unbanked individuals to gain access to monetary services.

That said, Cardano is not your average digital property. It is defined as a third-generation cryptocurrency with potential application in supply chain traceability and governance.

This indicates that Cardano may overtake Bitcoin, a first-generation cryptocurrency, by solving its scalability problems; Cardano may also overtake Ethereum, a second-generation cryptocurrency, by supplying a much safer peer-reviewed platform for clever agreements.

As Cardano designers specified, they attempt to "supply a more balanced and sustainable environment that much better represent the needs of its users along with other systems looking for combination."

Additionally, Cardano differentiated itself from other cryptos as it brought in teachers and scientists to integrate peer-reviewed and scholastic concepts into its design.

No surprise that Cardano managed to raise $62 million during its Initial Coin offering (ICO) and started working together with high-level companies across FinTech and academic sectors.

## How Does Cardano Work?

Cardano is a third-generation coin that intends to enhance scalability, interoperability, and sustainability to reach large-scale blockchain adoption.

Its development has been supported so far by three different organisations: the Cardano Foundation that manages the advancement of the Cardano community; Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) that constructs the blockchain; and EMURGO that looks after the promotion of Cardano's business applications.

Note that Cardano's advancement is set up in 5 stages or eras: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho and Voltaire, with Goguen being arranged for this year.

A distinct feature of Cardano is its 2 layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) used as a balance journal to settle deals and the Control Layer utilized for wise contracts. This separation permits organisations to custom-make the style and personal privacy of their agreements.

Here we ought to keep in mind that Cardano was able to process just 10 transactions per second, while now it has the ability to process around 257 deals per second. Hydra, Cardano's Layer 2 scaling, may help Cardano process over one million deals per second in the future.

Another special feature is its agreement system Ouroboros. Ouroboros is a chain-based proof-of-stake protocol, which includes mathematically verifiable security to reduce cyber attacks.

Cardano also counts on a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) to authorize brand-new initiatives and prevent divides.

Here it's worth pointing out that there are different Cardano dates that include slots, with slot leaders being selected through a coin tossing procedure.

## What Is ADA?

Cardano's native coin is called ADA. ADA is one of the top-performing digital properties in 2021.

Though this crypto has been on the market only for a couple of years, it managed to turn into one of the most traded coins in the crypto field. Keep in mind that there is a max supply of 45 billion ADA coins.
