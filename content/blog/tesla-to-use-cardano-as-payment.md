## Cardano x Tesla? 

A new rumour has begun circulating the on Crypto Twitter that Tesla will be using [Cardano](/link/buy-cardano) as their cryptocurrency payment system. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is a strong believer in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.  We have seen him speak vocally about Bitcoin and [Dogecoin](/link/buy-dogecoin), even doing a skit on [Dogecoin on SNL](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-10/dogecoin-and-elon-musk-on-snl-it-s-a-hustle-but-it-s-the-people-s-hustle) that ended with "It's a hustle."  Following his appearance on SNL the price of Dogecoin came crashing down.

Elon has been quoted saying "cryptocurrency would be used for all transactions" in the future. This coming from one of the most successful entrepreneurs on Earth.

## What is Cardano?

Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project. Cardano was created by Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum

The platform seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is built upon strong academic principles: peer-reviewed research; collaboration with academia, government bodies and regulators around the world.

## What did Elon Musk say about Bitcoin?

> “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment.
>
> “We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.”
>
> \- Elon Musk

## What are the alternatives?

With Bitcoin's Price crashing on the 13th April, many investors decided to switch to Cardano following the news.  This was evident with it being the only top performing crypto to be in the green following the announcement from Elon Musk.  Cardano has strong environmental credentials due to its low energy consumption and is the highest ranking Proof of Stake coin by Market Cap.

## How more energy efficient is Cardano than Bitcoin?

Cardano is amazingly **1.6 million times more energy efficient than Bitcoin** according to Cardano's founder Charles Hoskinson.

## Do Charles and Elon Musk know each other?

The two innovators are both aware of each other and have even been photographed together. Charles has even invited Elon to his farm to have "The Cardano conversation".  The phrasing of Charles's tweet is interesting as the use of "Finally going to have" sounds like they have been planning to have a discussion on Cardano for some time now.

Is there a possibility that there could be a new collaboration around the corner for Cardano and Tesla?  Let's admit it, stranger things have happened this year with Doge going to the moon and back following Elon's twitter feed.
