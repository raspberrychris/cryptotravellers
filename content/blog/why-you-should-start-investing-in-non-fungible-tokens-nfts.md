## NFTs: Non Fungible Tokens. What are they?

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are digital assets that are unique. They can be bought and sold on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC721 standard. The most famous example of this is CryptoKitties. While they might sound like a gimmick at first glance, there are some serious reasons why you should start investing in them today.

## How do NFTs work?

NFTs are a type of digital asset that can be owned, traded and sold on blockchain-powered marketplaces. They're also known as non fungible tokens because they have unique characteristics or attributes which make them different from one another in some way - for example their name might differ (e g CryptoKitty #1234) while other NTFS may vary by the number printed onto it (#12345). This is what makes these assets so valuable to collectors: if you own an individual token with certain traits then nobody else will ever possess this same item again.

  
CryptoKitties, which was a huge success story back in 2018 with over $25 million worth traded daily at its peak alone. This shows just how much demand there currently exists for NTFS as well their potential to grow even more popular.

## What is Cryptokitties?

Cryptokitties is a game where players can collect, breed and trade digital cats. The goal of the app was to create something that would be fun for people who are not usually interested in cryptocurrency or blockchain technology but still want an accessible way into this new world, which has been achieved with over one million downloads since its launch on November 28th 2017. This success led other companies like Ubisoft (creators behind Assassin's Creed) as well Disney Interactive Studios have created their own NFTs games too: "Frosty Friends" from WaltDisney Animation Studio lets you buy snowmen tokens using ETH.

  
The game itself was created by Axiom Zen who have also developed other successful games like Etherbots before it while being backed up financially from Andreessen Horowitz among others meaning you know these guys mean business about making sure people get quality products out here without any shady stuff going on.

## NFTs can be used in Games

NFTs are digital assets that can be traded and used in games like CryptoKitties, but they also have the potential to work as a form of currency for other things too such has buying or selling goods online without needing any middlemen involved which is what makes them so appealing from an investment perspective because you know there will always need someone out here who wants these items no matter how niche it may seem at first glance.

For example if I wanted some new shoes then instead having my money go through all sorts different channels before finally reaching its destination (which could take days) with NTFs this would happen instantly meaning less time waiting around while still getting exactly where we want our funds sent just by using the NFTs.

The other thing to keep in mind is that these tokens are not like any old cryptocurrency because they can be used for so many different purposes which means there will always need new people coming into this space and buying them up as time goes on.

This also makes it a lot easier when you're trying make money from trading with others who may want something specific or have an item of their own looking sell, all we would do then if I wanted some shoes was just find someone else out here selling those same items before making our trade happen instantly without having worry about anything getting lost along way thanks again due how easy everything becomes once using non fungible assets instead.

## Non Fungibles as digital assets

Non Fungibles are digital assets that cannot be duplicated and have a unique identity. They can represent anything from in-game items to real estate, artwork or even collectible cards. Non fungibility is what makes these tokens so special because it means there will always need new people coming into this space buying them up as time goes by which also make things easier when you're trying earn money trading with others who may want something specific of their own looking sell all we would do then if I wanted some shoes was just find someone else out here selling same item before making trade happen instantly without having worry about thing getting lost along way thanks again due how easy everything becomes once you start using NFTs.

The best part about this is that you can use these tokens to represent anything from in-game items, real estate or even collectible cards. Non fungibility means there will always need new people coming into space buying them up as time goes by which also make things easier when trying earn money trading with others who may want something specific of their own looking sell all we would do then if I wanted some shoes was just find someone else out here selling same item before making trade happen instantly without having worry at thing getting lost along way thanks again due how easy everything becomes once starting used non fungibles and now it's not uncommon for me be able go buy something I want without having to worry about it being sold out or not able find anywhere else.

Non fungibility also means that each token is unique and can be tracked on the blockchain, meaning you know where your items are at all times which make things a lot safer for everyone involved in trade as well.

## Why You Should Start Investing in Non-Fungible Tokens

The idea of non fungibility is that each token has its own unique ID and can be tracked on the blockchain, meaning you know where your items at all times. This makes things a lot safer for everyone involved with trade as well.

Trading becomes easier when there's no worry about getting lost along way or not being able to find something anywhere else because it'll always been available somewhere out here thanks again due how easy everything become once starting used these tokens now I'm more than happy go buy anything without having have worries if they're sold out elsewhere which make life so much better too me since then don't need spend hours looking around town.

NFTs are a new type of asset that is not fungible. This means each token has its own unique ID and can be tracked on the blockchain, meaning you know where your items at all times.

## What makes NFT tokens so unique and valuable?

NFTs are "Non-Fungible Tokens" made on the Ethereum blockchain. You can buy, sell, trade and collect these digital assets in a secure way by using an ERC-20 compatible wallet like Metamask or MyEtherWallet (via Chrome browser). The Cool Cousin marketplace uses NFTs to let users quickly purchase products from local merchants - all without exchanging international currency. NFTs are also more difficult than ever before counterfeit or stolen in transit.

## Are NFTs bad for the environment?

NFTs are not bad for the environment, in fact they're good! NTFS can be recycled and reused which means less waste. The best part about owning your very first Cryptokitties? You'll never need more than two cats since each cat has its genetic code stored within every new one you purchase - so no matter how many kitty's there may become on earth or if someone clones them all (which is impossible), it will always have a unique set of genes that make up their personality traits.

## Are NFTs a good investment?

NFTs are a great investment! The value of NTF is dependent on the popularity and rarity. This means that if you buy an item for $100, but it becomes worth more than what someone would pay to purchase your token from another user in-game or off, then its market price will increase as well because demand has increased due so there's less supply available.
