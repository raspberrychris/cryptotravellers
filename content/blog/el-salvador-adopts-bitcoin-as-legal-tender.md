**El Salvador's President** [**Nayib Bukele**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayib_Bukele) **has said that he will make Bitcoin legal tender in the country.  If this happens it would make El Salvador the first country to formally adopt Bitcoin alongside its national currency, the US Dollar.**

> "In the short term, this will generate jobs and help provide financial inclusion to thousands outside the formal economy," - Mr Bukele told a Bitcoin conference in Florida

Around 70% of El Salvador doesn't have a bank account.  With over 2 million Salvadorans living outside of the country they currently send back around $4 billion dollars each year.

This is a very positive thing for Bitcoin adoption having an entire country announcing its attention to make Bitcoin Legal Tender.

## Why does the President want to do this?

El Salvador is a cash economy by large.  Most citizens do not have a bank account.  70% of the population do not have bank accounts or credit cards.  Their adoption will utilise their phones as a bank account, paying bills and send and receive crypto across the world.  This will also help combat fiat inflation, if it gains mass adoption.
