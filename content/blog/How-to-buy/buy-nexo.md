## What is Nexo?

The Nexo platform offers instant crypto-backed loans to customers while still letting them retain full ownership of their digital assets. These tokens are SEC compliant and pay out dividends so it is a great opportunity for those who want the benefits from both worlds - keeping your coins and accessing cash when you need it!

Nexoâ€™s native token, NEXO, is a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-compliant security token that pays ongoing dividends

## How does NEXO work?

Nexo is powered by Credissimo, a European financial services company founded in 2007. This online lender launched the Nexo platform in April 2018 and it's regulated by multiple EU regulators to provide you with more security than ever before!

Nexo is an instant lending platform that allows users to offer their cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans. To access a loan, customers need to transfer the crypto assets into Nexo wallet in order then they can be accessed with cash from fiat currencies like US dollars and Euros or yen. The funds are secured by the market value of your cryptocurrency stored on Nexo's system; you just have one quick process when applying for these short-term loans which only takes minutes

## How to Buy Nexo Step by Step

Once your account is set up, make sure to fill out all required information on the registration form and provide any proof they may ask for!

Buying NEXO.** The third step is to purchase your tokens, you can do this by navigating your way to the exchange page on your chosen platform and then specifying how many NEXO token you want buy, usually in BTC or ETH.
