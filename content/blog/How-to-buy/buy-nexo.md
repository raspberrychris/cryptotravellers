## What is Nexo?

The Nexo platform offers instant crypto-backed loans to customers while still letting them retain full ownership of their digital assets. These tokens are SEC compliant and pay out dividends so it is a great opportunity for those who want the benefits from both worlds - keeping your coins and accessing cash when you need it!

Nexoâ€™s native token, NEXO, is a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-compliant security token that pays ongoing dividends

## How to Buy Nexo Step by Step

**Step 1.** Register for an account with one of the exchanges that list NEXO in a currency pair you are interested in trading. Once your account is set up, make sure to fill out all required information on the registration form and provide any proof they may ask for!  Some exchanges require additional information including your personal details and proof of ID, so make sure to compare all fees before deciding on one!

To purchase these crypto assets you need Bitcoin (BTC) or Etherium (ETH), both of which trade with NEXO on popular exchanges like Binance. You don't want your savings sitting around while they're depreciating so get them into this token now before it's too late!

**Step 2.** If you want to deposit BTC or ETH into your account, then there are a few steps that need to be followed. First of all find the address for your exchange wallet and copy it down or scan in the QR code so you know where funds will go. Second, choose which currency (BTC/ETH)you plan on depositing as well as what type of transaction is happening: incoming transfer from an external wallet OR outgoing transfer from this exchange's hot storage holdings). Lastly fill out some information about yourself like how much money should be deposited at once and whether they'll continue trading with these coins after receiving them
