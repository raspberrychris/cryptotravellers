## What is Nexo?

The Nexo platform offers instant crypto-backed loans to customers while still letting them retain full ownership of their digital assets. These tokens are SEC compliant and pay out dividends so it is a great opportunity for those who want the benefits from both worlds - keeping your coins and accessing cash when you need it!

Nexoâ€™s native token, NEXO, is a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-compliant security token that pays ongoing dividends

## How to Buy Nexo Step by Step

**Step 1.** Register for an account with one of the exchanges that list NEXO in a currency pair you are interested in trading. Once your account is set up, make sure to fill out all required information on the registration form and provide any proof they may ask for!  Some exchanges require additional information including your personal details and proof of ID, so make sure to compare all fees before deciding on one!
