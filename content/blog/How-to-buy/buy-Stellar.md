## What is Stellar?

Stellar Lumens (XLM) offers a way to close transactions of any size without requiring an intermediary. It provides low costs: no more than 20 cents per transaction irrespective on volume or currency type; scalable efficiency that can handle up to 1000 operations/second so your money gets where it needs quickly & reliably, minimising fraud as well because every operation has its own unique signature. And they operate 24 hours each day.

Transaction limits vary by account level from 100 XLM daily down to 0 at high volumes but usually less restrictive than other networks like Bitcoin's 25 BTC limit . And finally, Stellar offers the promise of a more inclusive financial system that is open to all, not just the few.

**XLM** is built on technology designed by Jed McCaleb in 2014 and originally based off Ripple's protocol with some modifications: it doesn't use mining (creating coins out of thin air) or require any central authority for transactions; instead they rely upon an interlinked network where each node validates two randomly selected previous nodes before creating new blocks - this ensures no single point can manipulate data unilaterally without detection from other participants within their own respective database systems- making them faster than Bitcoin & Litecoin which take about ten minutes per block whereas XLM takes only five seconds! This also means there will never be "printable" paper wallets because every address is also a private key.
