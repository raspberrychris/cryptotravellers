## What is CRO in Crypto?

Crypto.org Coin (CRO) is the native token of Crypto.org Chain, a blockchain network for cryptocurrency project and merchant adoption to accept crypto as a form of payment.

The Crypto.org Chain is a high-performing native blockchain solution, which will make the transaction flows between crypto users and merchants accepting crypto seamless, cost-efficient and secure. Businesses can use Crypto.com pay Checkout and/or Invoice to enable customers to complete checkout by paying for goods with cryptocurrencies using their app's wallet feature.

Businesses can receive their payments in CRO and stable coins or fiat. This is because the Crypto.org Coin price page, which features an overview of prices for all cryptocurrencies as well as live charts with data such as market cap and ticker tools to keep track of current changes in value, has now been incorporated into the top crypto index on Cryptocurrency.com
