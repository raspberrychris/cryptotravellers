## What is Aave?

[Aave](https://aave.com/) is a decentralized finance protocol that allows users to borrow and lend cryptocurrency using an anonymous platform. Previously known as ETHLend, Aave was launched in November 2017 with the goal of establishing trustless lending interactions supported by smart contracts and blockchain technology. On their network, lenders can earn interest on the amount of cryptocurrency available to borrowers by depositing tokens into a liquidity pool. Borrowers ensure they pay back what's lent them through crypto collateral deposits while avoiding any centralized authority or middleman (such as banks).

> _Aave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralised (perpetually) or undercollateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion._
