## What is Polkadot?

**Polkadot** is a scalable, heterogeneous, multi-chain technology that allows diverse blockchains to transfer messages in a trust-free fashion.

Polkadot is an open-source project which aims to bridge the gap between public and private blockchains. It achieves this by allowing for an unlimited number of parallel chains linked together using relays (which connect compatible networks). This allows them to communicate across different ledgers without having to copy all transactions back and forth in order to process them sequentially. The main goal is to allow for a variety of applications on one platform while maintaining their independence from each other.
