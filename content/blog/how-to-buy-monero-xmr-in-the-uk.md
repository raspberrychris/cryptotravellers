> There are several ways to [buy Monero](buy-monero-xmr) directly with GBP.  Purchasing Monero can be a bit more complicated than other cryptos, but it’s also less expensive.

In this blog post, we will discuss the best ways to [buy Monero in the UK](/buy-monero-xmr). We'll cover how to use a cryptocurrency exchange, as well as peer-to-peer exchanges and marketplaces. You'll also find out about some of the risks associated with buying Monero online and what you can do to minimise those risks.

Some people think that it's better not to store your coins in an account or platform if possible which means relying on physical storage like [hardware wallets](https://cryptotravellers.com/blog/trezor-model-t-review/) for example instead (which are usually safer than software).

## How to buy Monero with fiat currency

You can buy Monero with fiat currency on a cryptocurrency exchange, such as [Coinbase](link/coinbase).  You can also buy Monero with Fiat currencies from peer-to-peer exchanges or marketplaces

On some websites, you might also be able to trade for Monero using other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).  In the case where it is possible, there will usually be an option of 'Monero' in order to make the transaction easier.

It's possible that you might be able to find someone on the internet who sells Monero for fiat currency through an account with PayPal, but this isn't something which can be guaranteed and it can sometimes take weeks of communications before such transactions go ahead successfully. The best advice would be to avoid these methods unless absolutely necessary as there are many other ways of buying Monero (XMR) more reliably than this at present.

## What are some of the risks associated with buying Monero online?

There are many risks associated with buying Monero online, chief among which is the risk of identity theft and fraud.

## What can I do if someone has hacked my account?

If you suspect that your account has been compromised, there are some steps which you should take straight away, including: changing your password; logging out  of any other devices you are logged into; uninstalling the app from your device.

## What is a Monero wallet?

A [Monero Wallet](https://mymonero.com/) can be downloaded to store, send or receive XMR in an encrypted electronic format. The funds on these accounts cannot be accessed without entering a password of some kind which means that if someone were able to access this file then they could not do anything with it unless they knew the password. These wallets must also have their own private keys - meaning only he/she has possession of them - for anyone else to gain access to the transaction history stored within. And once again, we advise against using any service where there is no two-factor authentication enabled.

The Monero Wallet has a variety of features that allow it to be used as an all-in-one solution for your crypto currency needs. It is able to integrate with other wallets, so you can connect them together in order to exchange between different currencies and assets more efficiently - this will also make sure your funds are always available on whichever device you choose at any given time.
