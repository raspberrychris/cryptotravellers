## What is Cardano (ADA)?

> **_"Cardano_ is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods.  ... \[Cardano is\] A new type of currency. A new means of transaction. Direct. Secure. From Anywhere. For Everyone" - Via** [**Cardano.org**](https://cardano.org/)

**Cardano** is a cryptocurrency and open source project that is seeking to improve the world through technological progress. Cardano was created as a result of scientific research, engineering thought leadership, and input from many expert stakeholders and leading academics around the globe. The team behind Cardano aims to create a platform for global financial services that can be trusted that exists outside of our current centralised financial system.

Cardano has three core principles: academic rigour, robust engineering, and an inclusive community. This blog post will discuss what makes Cardano different than other cryptocurrencies on the market today.

> "A platform built for a sustainable future, to help people work better together, trust one another, and build global solutions to global problems." Via [Cardano.org](https://cardano.org/)

## What does Cardano Mean?

The Cardano project is named after the mathematician, scientist and philosopher who invented "Cardan's Formula," a way to calculate the geometric sum of three unknown quantities. The Cardano team chose this symbol as an ode to his work in algebraic geometry.

## What is ADA?

Cardano's token ADA is named after [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace): a 19th-century mathematician who is recognised as the first computer programmer, and is the daughter of the poet [Lord Byron.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron)

## What can you do with ADA?

ADA is a digital currency and as such can be used as an exchange of value without requiring a 3rd party to be involved with the transaction (E.g. Paypal).

## Are Cardano And Polkadot Competitors?

No, Cardano is not a competitor to the Polkadot project. Cardano’s goal is create a platform for global financial services that can be trusted and used by anybody in any part of the world. This will use blockchain technology and it does have some similarities with what Polkadot aims to do - however there are  a few differences.

The Cardano team, in [partnership with the Ethiopian government](https://www.coindesk.com/from-paper-to-cardano-blockchain-iohk-in-ethiopia) is currently using blockchain technology to resolve the issue of fake certifications in Education and give students in Ethiopia a way to record their progress using  NFC cards.

Polkadot aims to create an entirely new internet for  decentralised networks, where many different blockchains will be able to form interconnected spaces. Cardano is not focusing on achieving this goal in the same way - they are instead creating a platform that provides an environment for decentralised applications.

## Why do some people say Cardano Is Dead?

Cardano is not dead nor dying. Cardano has been at the top of the cryptocurrency market for a while now.  [Cardano is currently in the top 10 by coin by Market Capitalisation](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/).  Cardano is also relatively new compared to many of its competitors.

## Are Cardano Fees High?

No. Cardano fees are low in comparison to other cryptocurrencies like [Bitcoin](/buy-bitcoin) and [Ethereum](/buy-ethereum). This is due to their consensus algorithm called [Ouroboros](https://cardano.org/ouroboros/) which utilises Proof-of-Stake rather than power hungry mining hardware as seen on competing blockchains.

**Cardano Fee Structure:** [**https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-fee-structure.html**](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-fee-structure.html "https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-fee-structure.html")

## Are Cardano Stake Pools Safe?

Yes. Cardano stake pools are safe due to the fact that they can only use ADA and not other cryptocurrencies, which means there is no risk of investment loss outside of this pool like on Bitcoin or Ethereum's mining setups.

The primary disadvantage in using a Cardano stakepool is you will be sharing all rewards with everyone else  in the pool.

Notwithstanding, Cardano stake pools are still a viable investment and can earn large returns. There is also no risk of losing value due to other currencies or tokens being used in mining which may lead to significant losses on investments elsewhere.

No matter what your needs are as an ADA holder, there should be some sort  Cardano is a versatile cryptocurrency.

## Are Cardano Coins Limited?

Cardano has a finite supply, with an estimated total of 45 billion ADA in circulation. The idea behind this is that Cardano's price will increase as the number of coins available gradually decreases.

## Is Cardano Staking Profitable?

Cardano have created a [staking calculator ](https://cardano.org/calculator/)that enables you to work out what rewards you will receive based on your ADA investment.  In our example below, a 10,000 ADA investment you could expect to receive $811 on a yearly basis.

![cardano-staking-calculator](/uploads/ada-rewards-calculator.png)

## Are Cardano Pools Safe?

Cardano pools are safe if the pool is well maintained and have a good reputation.  Ensure to do your research before hand.

## What Are Cardano Staking Rewards?

Cardano offers a consensus algorithm called **Ouroboros**. Besides being distributed, it also provides Cardano with rewards for creating blocks and maintaining the blockchain (more on this below).

\- Cardano's Proof of Stake system is known as "[Ouroboros](https://cardano.org/ouroboros/)." This unique security mechanism has been argued by many experts to be one of the best in the world.

\- In a PoS system, people who own tokens are allowed to participate and earn rewards for maintaining the blockchain ledger through individual nodes on their computers

## What Are Cardano Smart Contracts?

Cardano's [smart contracts](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/) can be considered "a little smarter than [Ethereum](/buy-ethereum)." The reason for this is that they are able to work with many different types of cryptocurrencies, not just ADA.

> Goguen will also see improvements to the core Cardano offering. Most significantly, the addition of a multi-currency ledger will extend the usefulness of Cardano even further, enabling users to create new natively-supported tokens. This will allow the creation of fungible and non-fungible tokens, supporting the creation of new cryptocurrencies on Cardano as well as the tokenization of many types of digital and physical assets. Another benefit will be easier integration of smart contracts and DApps involving multiple cryptocurrencies. - Via [Cardano.org](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/)

\- This makes them more flexible and allows them to do much more in terms of functionality.

\- Cardano smart contracts are also written in a  programming  language called [Plutus](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/plutus/overview/), which is similar to Haskell.

\- One of the best features of Cardano smart contracts is that they are designed for formal verification. This means that every action will be mathematically checked and verified before it gets sent out on the network.

## Can Cardano Overtake Ethereum?

This a question a lot of new investors ask when they are considering what to invest in.  Cardano is a cryptocurrency and blockchain project that has its own distributed ledger. Cardano seeks to provide users with even more privacy than Ethereum while also making the user experience as easy-to-use as possible for developers, which can then create DApps on top of Cardano's platform. Cardano uses a Proof-of-Stake  algorithm to verify transactions, and has a significant focus on making sure the system is as scalable as possible.

Cardano also features a language called Haskell that enables developers to write code in a "pluggable" way, meaning they can choose among different back-end languages such as C++ and Rust without having to rewrite it all from scratch.

Cardano also uses two unique features called Ouroboros, which is Cardano's Proof-of-Stake algorithm to verify transactions, and has a significant focus on making sure the system is as scalable as possible. The other feature of Cardano is called the Cardano Settlement Layer, which handles ADA transactions.

Cardano's goal is to eventually become a system that can manage smart contracts and digital assets with formal verification of code and secure data storage. It also aims to be able to conduct high-volume instantaneous transactions while maintaining low transaction fees.

## Can Cardano Be Mined?

Cardano operates on a proof of stake model rather than a proof of work, meaning it can't be mined per se. Cardano's Proof-of-Stake algorithm is called **Ouroboros** and it allows users to stake ADA in order to verify transactions.

[The Cardano Settlement Layer](https://why.cardano.org/en/introduction/designing-in-layers/) process handles the sending and receiving of digital assets like ADA or other cryptocurriences among parties while the smart contracts side manages any type of agreement between

## How Cardano Staking Works?

Cardano is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) cryptocurrency, which means that any Cardano user can be rewarded with new ADA tokens if they allow their wallet to connect to the network and act as a “staking node”. Staking nodes will receive newly minted coins in return for helping maintain the security of   Cardano’s blockchain. These nodes are randomly chosen to create new blocks of transactions and receive rewards in the form of Cardano tokens for completing a set number of successful “confirmations” - or verifications that their block conforms to Cardano rules. Blocks can take minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even months to Convert Cardano (ADA) to Other Cryptocurrencies

Converting any cryptocurrency can be done at many online exchanges. This is usually as simple as inputting the wallet address of the currency that you want to receive and a desired payment amount, then waiting for your new coins to arrive in your account. Some popular options are Changelly,

## How Will Cardano Change The World?

\- Cardano is a smart contract platform that supports complex computations.

\- It is an open source, decentralised and public blockchain network with high security levels, which includes many advanced features such as decentralised applications (DDpp), sidechains and quantum resistance signatures.

\- The aim of Cardano is to compete with Ethereum by providing more

## How is Cardano Is Created?

In Cardano's system, a process called \`Ouroboros\` generates new blocks. To execute this process, there is a set of nodes that are randomly chosen and run in parallel to come up with solutions for the next block. This randomization prevents any one person from manipulating the network because they would need at least 51% of  the total number of nodes running to accomplish such a task.  This is just one way Cardano attempts to create an egalitarian system, giving more power and control back into the hands of the people.

## What is the Cardano Giveaway Scam?

As the price of Cardano ADA continues to rise there have been an increasing number of sophisticated (and non sophisticated scams that are targeting Cardano investors.  Charles Hoskinson has been very vocal that Cardano Never gives away any ADA.  Despite this warning there have been YouTube live events that have featured older interviews with Charles in that encourage people to send money in exchange for more Cardano "rewards".
