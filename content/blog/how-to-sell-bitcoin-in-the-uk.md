## Further Considerations when buying and selling Bitcoin

### Should I get a Hardware wallet to store my bitcoin?

Having a **hardware wallet** to store your bitcoin is not essential in order to buy and sell crypto but it can be useful from a security perspective.  The [Trezor Model T](/link/trezor-model-t) supports a wide range of crypto currencies and is best for HODLing your BTC.  Alternatives to the Trezor include the [Ledger](/link/ledger), which is also a good wallet for HODLing and is cheaper than the Trezor Model T.  Ultimately we would advise that a hardware or other wallet would be a better way to store your bitcoin than on a centralised exchange.

### Not your keys, not your coins

Not your keys, not your coins is an expression used within the crypto community that encourages Bitcoin hodlers to store their bitcoin in more secure places other than centralised exchanges.  If you don't own the private keys then you are effectively entrusting your bitcoin to a 3rd party.  After the recent hacks of various crypto exchanges it is definitely worth investing in a hardware wallet if you have a substantial amount on BTC.
