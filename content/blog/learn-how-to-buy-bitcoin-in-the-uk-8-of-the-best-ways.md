## Crypto.com

Crypto.com is a service that allows you to buy bitcoin through GBP deposits and has 0% fees! Crypto.com also offers the option of buying cryptocurrencies at real exchange rates, but this only works for EURO (EUR) deposits right now because it's temporarily disabled in other currencies with them having temporary workarounds currently available on their site as well if interested in using those methods instead or even until they can fix everything up again which will be within 24 hours according to an email received by one user who contacted customer support about Bitcoin being unavailable there during these times while crypto markets are open so should not have any problems converting into BTC/ETH once more eventually soon enough without causing major issues including anything else needed like ID verification etc

## CoinJar

CoinJar is the UKâ€™s premier cryptocurrency broker for buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Founded in 2013, CoinJar makes it easy to buy Bitcoin with a bank transfer from your country of residence at a 1% fixed fee or trade fiat currencies like USD, EURO & AUD on their platform. You can also get $10 worth of free crypto when you sign up!

You'll be charged a 1% fixed fee when you purchase bitcoins through this service but will receive quotes that are slightly higher than global market averages so there's no need to worry about getting below-market prices if by chance they happen near publication date.
