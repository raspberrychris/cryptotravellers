## 1. Coinbase Pro

Coinbase Pro is a cheap way to buy bitcoin in the UK. They were granted an e-money license, which no other major cryptocurrency exchange had before them! This big deal means that you can deposit British Pounds (GBP) via Faster Payments - and it's been one of Coinbase’s best features for years now!

A recent upgrade has made their GBP deposits even cheaper than ever: just 0.5% on all transfers from your bank account*.

## 2. Crypto.com

Crypto.com is a service that allows you to buy bitcoin through GBP deposits and has 0% fees! Crypto.com also offers the option of buying cryptocurrencies at real exchange rates, but this only works for EURO (EUR) deposits right now because it's temporarily disabled in other currencies with them having temporary workarounds currently available on their site as well if interested in using those methods instead or even until they can fix everything up again which will be within 24 hours according to an email received by one user who contacted customer support about Bitcoin being unavailable there during these times while crypto markets are open so should not have any problems converting into BTC/ETH once more eventually soon enough without causing major issues including anything else needed like ID verification etc

## 3. CoinJar

CoinJar is the UK’s premier cryptocurrency broker for buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Founded in 2013, CoinJar makes it easy to buy Bitcoin with a bank transfer from your country of residence at a 1% fixed fee or trade fiat currencies like USD, EURO & AUD on their platform. You can also get free crypto when you sign up!

You'll be charged a 1% fixed fee when you purchase bitcoins through this service but will receive quotes that are slightly higher than global market averages so there's no need to worry about getting below-market prices if by chance they happen near publication date.

## 4. Luno

Established in 2013, Luno is a UK-based cryptocurrency broker that’s made it simple to buy bitcoin (and other popular cryptocurrencies). When you deposit GBP with a bank transfer from the UK, you will be charged 1.5% when buying or selling bitcoins - which may seem like high fees at first glance. However, I found their rates are usually close to what they should actually cost!

You can also purchase altcoins through credit card and PayPal as long as your own those payment methods linked up on your account page. Currently there are only eleven coins available for users: Bitcoin Cash ABC/BCH; Ethereum ETH; Litecoin LTC; Ripple XRP ; Stellar XLM ; Monero XMR

## 5. Wirex

Wirex is a UK-based company that allows its customers to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with their debit cards, credit card or bank transfers. This service has been made possible by the introduction of blockchain technology as it uses SWIFT codes for international transactions (which are way cheaper than using wire transfer). It might not be so user-friendly but once you get used to it, trading would become easier.

Wirex charges only 1% on top of an exchange rate which can vary from time depending on market fluctuations while Coinbase takes about 3%.

## 6. Solidi & Bittylicious

There are two ways to buy bitcoin in the UK. Solidi and Bittylicious both allow you to buy it with a simple GBP bank transfer, but they operate in much different ways. With Solidi, for example:  You plug in how much you’d like to purchase and then one of their registered brokers will be matched up with your order (the cheapest broker that can fulfil that amount). Bittylicous operates quite similarly; however instead of matching buyers based on price alone, they match them by taking into account which ones have requested similar amounts so as not only get the best deal possible - but also ensure quick delivery times!

## 7. Coinfloor

Coinfloor is a reputable UK bitcoin exchange that focuses on connection traders, brokers and large investors. It has been around since 2013 which makes it the longest established one in the country. They are active with GBP deposits through Faster Payments meaning your money will appear quickly after transferring to Coinfloor's account for trading purposes.

## 8. Local Bitcoins

Localbitcoins is a site that aims to convert your local currency into the cryptocurrency bitcoin. You can post ads on this website for conversion rates and payment methods, or browse through other people's postings if you're interested in exchanging currencies with them!

Payment Methods available include:

* Bank transfer (Faster Payments)
* Debit & Credit Card
* PayPal
* Western Union
* Altcoins (e.g., DASH, XRP, XMR)
* Gift cards
