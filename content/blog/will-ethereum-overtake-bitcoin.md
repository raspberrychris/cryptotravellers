> Data from Blockchain Center shows that Ethereum already has more nodes, transactions, and fees than Bitcoin. However, in terms of market cap, Ethereum is still behind by $200 billion compared to Bitcoinâ€™s current market cap of $1 trillion.

[Bitcoin](https://cryptotravellers.com/buy-bitcoin) has been the number one cryptocurrency for a long time, but there is another cryptocurrency that may soon surpass it. [Ethereum](https://cryptotravellers.com/buy-ethereum) was created back in 2013 as a platform where developers can build decentralised applications and smart contracts without any downtime. It also features its own token called ether which has many uses on the Ethereum network. But how will this affect Bitcoin's future?

There are many factors that will affect the future of Bitcoin. One very important factor is whether or not people think it has any long-term potential, which may be affected by Ethereum's popularity as a cryptocurrency and smart contract platform, it does have some advantages over bitcoin such being able to process transactions much more quickly using its own blockchain network rather than relying on another one for processing power like how Bitcoin must rely upon miners in order get transaction verified through mining algorithms but still takes considerably longer when compared against an average time interval between

## What are the benefits of Ethereum?

The benefits of Ethereum are that it will be able to process transactions much more quickly using its own blockchain network rather than relying on another one for processing power like how Bitcoin must rely upon miners in order get transaction verified through mining algorithms but still takes considerably longer when compared against an average time interval between. It also has the ability and potentiality with now being a cryptocurrency as well, which can lead towards commercialising many different aspects within life such where money is exchanged or digital rights along other things all while interacting together without any third party needed.

## What are the benefits of Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency powered by the blockchain. It has many advantages over fiat currencies, but it also comes with risks and disadvantages as well that should be taken into consideration before investing in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for this matter. Bitcoin offers which includes lower transaction fees than traditional methods of payment such like Visa/Mastercard credit cards due being able learn more without even clicking through links on their site while still having security features built-in that will prevent thefts from happening since they are not tied down by one central server where all transactions happen at once, so if there were ever an outage then only some people would lose access rather doing everyone else who rely upon accessing financial records for other reasons.

If you're considering investing in Bitcoin or any currency, it's important to understand the implications of purchasing cryptocurrency - and how they differ from traditional "fiat" currencies like dollars (USD) - before taking action so that your money is not put at risk because one wrong move could wipe out all profits made previously while also losing more than just a few pennies due incurring high fees per transaction when sending anything overseas using this form payment method; which results with higher exchange rates since people are unwilling accept low amounts as transactions through their platforms without having an attached fee included within those totals being sent across borders whether virtually via email attachment/through file sharing such though these methods can be monitored by companies who track IP addresses rather than the sender's location.

The other, more common form of payment by individuals which can also be seen as an advantage to some is Bitcoin (BTC) - a cryptocurrency that was created back in 2009 and has since gone on with its existence being tracked through blockchain technology; where it all kicked off from when this new-generation currency first came onto scene starting out at $0 per bitcoin but now worth over $8000 each unit while having fluctuating prices due demand/supply factors because there isn't any type regulating body overseeing such or anything like central banks running things behind scenes unlike fiat currencies whose value are set according for their money supply available within countries' borders making them less vulnerable against fluctuations happening across global markets therefore keeping inflation low internally rather than externally in the meantime.

Initially bitcoin was set up to be a type of digital cash providing users with anonymity whereas Ethereum is more geared towards being an all-purpose programmable blockchain that can not only store information but also process it unlike other cryptocurrencies where transactions are processed on their own separate blocks, as for example if you were sending money from one wallet address over another then this would happen off block while now following Ethereum's model; transaction data will still stay within same single chain which could have many advantages such having no need storing anything outside ledger and making dealings much faster because there won't any waiting periods between each new batch processing coming through during operation time frame versus Bitcoin system doing so every ten minutes rather than seconds like when using Ether coin combined

## Ethereum Price Prediction 2021?

Some Crypto Youtubers have said that it is likely we will see a $27,000 Ethereum by the end of the year. This seems high at the time of writing, but in this bull market, anything could be possible.  Check out the video below from MMCrypto and Bitboy Crypto.
