## Introduction

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that has seen its value skyrocket in recent years. Some people think of it as an investment vehicle while others see it as a currency with the potential to be used across borders without any fees.

> The question remains: does Bitcoin offer real returns for investors?

The price of Bitcoin has exploded in the last few weeks. It is currently valued at $10,000 USD per BTC. This digital currency has been a great investment for those early adopters who have held onto it since 2010 when it was worth just pennies.  

### What is fuelling this sudden growth? Is Bitcoin an inflation hedge?

Is bitcoin a good way to protect against inflation? The answer could be yes and no. On one hand, as long as demand grows faster than supply then the value will go up with inflation rates (assuming that there are more people demanding bitcoins than there are willing to sell them). However, if you think about how quickly we've seen the rise in value of Bitcoin over the past week or two,

## Bitcoin the best hedge against inflation
Hardcore Bitcoin enthusiasts say the digital coin is the world’s best hedge against rising consumer prices. The logic: Unlike U.S. dollars or any other normal currency, it’s designed to have a limited supply, so it can’t be devalued by a government or a central bank distributing too much of it.

## Bitcoin has a limited supply

Bitcoin seems a good hedge versus inflation due to the fact that, unlike government-issued fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, the British pound, and the euro, supply of the crypto-currency is limited.

Typically, limited supply and strong need drives the cost greater.  Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve, the country's central bank, there is no overarching digital authority that can undercut the worth of Bitcoin by flooding the market.  President Richard Nixon took the dollar off the gold requirement in 1971. Some believe this successfully made the dollar's value a short article of faith.

## Money Printing to the tune of $1.9 trillion

From 1975 to right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, the U.S. money supply has increased from about $273.4 billion to about $4 trillion. It increased to about $6.5 trillion last November, mainly thanks to coronavirus stimulus bills intended to keep the economy running.

President Joe Biden has proposed a brand-new stimulus bundle totalling $1.9 trillion. If signed into law, more than half of the overall supply of dollars would have been printed because the pandemic struck.

## So is Increased inflation ahead?

Some fear that an increased number of dollars going after minimal items and services will result in future inflation.

If so, inflation would hammer savers and retirees on a set earnings who hold dollars. Most cash market accounts at business banks pay 0.50% or less in interest, and yearly cost-of-living increases in Social Security are usually modest.

Does it make good sense for Uncle Sam to obtain cash, even at existing low rates, and provide it to people to spend? Does the country face a lack of need, or an absence of chance to spend because much of the economy has shut down, including dining establishments, bars, travel and home entertainment?

Despite the financial contraction at the height of the lockdown meant to curb spread of the coronavirus, some sectors of the realty market stay strong.

Those who stayed employed, especially the informed who can work from another location from home on a computer system, left major cities for the suburban areas and backwoods. This resulted in property rate boosts in some outlying areas.

**Friedrich Hayek**, who shared the 1974 Nobel Prize in Economics, prompted the creation of private currencies that would enable banks to contend for approval. He said stability of value would be the definitive element for acceptance.

Hayek said government-issued currency had all the problems of a monopoly and prevented the development of brand-new techniques of exchange. Hayek died in 1992. Bitcoin was developed in 2009.

Could Bitcoin and crypto-currencies belong to what Hayek envisioned? Lots of see only shallow parallels while others cheer. The debate continues. Nevertheless, the worth of Bitcoin can't be eroded by increasing the supply because the variety of coins is capped at 21 million.

Nonetheless, Bitcoin was recently valued at $29,881.56, down 5.53%. Earlier this month, the crypto-currency reached almost $42,000.

Significant organisations are purchasing Bitcoin, apparently as an inflation hedge.

Precious metals such as gold have generally been utilised as a store of worth. However it's impossible to understand just how much gold exists in the world and how much can be economically mined.

The price of Bitcoin has been unstable in the past, but volatility and threat aren't always the same. Last year, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil briefly turned unfavourable as need collapsed during the economic shutdown. However in an economy built on oil, there was no threat investors would abandon the commodity and costs rebounded.

Immediate fears of inflation appear to have driven Bitcoin's cost greater.

The crypto-currency's status as a hedge versus inflation might be a good bet given that another stimulus package remains in the works and the brand-new administration is going over extra government spending on facilities and other programs.

However does purchasing Bitcoin for the long-term represent anything aside from imagine future cost appreciation?

In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith kept in mind:

*"A prince who ought to enact that a particular proportion of his taxes must be paid in fiat money of a certain kind might therefore give a specific value to this fiat money, despite the fact that the regard to its last discharge and redemption ought to depend completely upon the will of the prince."*

Could we relax if Bitcoin were the coin of the realm since it is a decentralised cryptocurrency, so there would be no Bitcoin prince?

On the other hand, what would take place if a cabal of super-nerds-- princes of the digital age-- formulate another crypto-currency with fewer than 21 million coins in circulation?
