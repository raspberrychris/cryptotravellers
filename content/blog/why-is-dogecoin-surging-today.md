> Dogecoin is up more than 2,600% this year. This cryptocurrency is certainly making waves, and has seen celebrity interest from Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg.

Today, the Dogecoin price has dominated social media. At least one person or company might be making real money on this surge in value for dogecoins. In February, word escaped that an unknown entity currently holds roughly 28% of the Dogecoin in circulation.
